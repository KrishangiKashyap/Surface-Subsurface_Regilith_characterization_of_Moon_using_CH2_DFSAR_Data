# Surface-Subsurface_Regilith_characterization_of_Moon_using_CH2_DFSAR_Data

First step of analysis is as follows - fully polarimetric Seleno-Referenced Image (SRI) of Faustini (a south polar crater) is opened in grey scale & RGB false color using Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) & Python for both L & S band data and image histograms are plotted using Matplotlib.

Main tasks are to characterize the properties of target present on the particular Faustini crater PSR by doing polarimetric decomposition and retrieving dielectric constant using IEM backscatter model with the help ANN model. 

A few pictures of HH, HV and VV polarized backscattered energy of the region are shown below,
